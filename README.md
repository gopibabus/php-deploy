# Getting Started

These are all static web files, which you can serve with any web server.

If you want to watch the videos without the HTML wrapper, you can just head straight to the `videos` directory.

## Easy Suggestions

With PHP's built-in server:

```php
# Serve sites on port 8080 using PHP
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```
